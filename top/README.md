# Roguelike Shooter

A simple web-based PvE roguelike shooter.

## How to Play
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
   - **Note:** Because this project uses ES Modules (`import`/`export`), you might need to run it through a local web server instead of just double-clicking the file.
   - If you are using VS Code, install the "Live Server" extension, right-click `index.html`, and choose "Open with Live Server".
2. **Controls:**
   - **WASD / Arrows:** Move
   - **Mouse:** Aim
   - **Left Click:** Shoot
3. **Goal:**
   - Survive waves of enemies.
   - Enemies have different traits (Red: Normal, Blue: Tank, Yellow: Fast).
   - Collect upgrades after every wave to improve your stats.

## Features
- Auto-aiming bullets (homing).
- Wave-based progression.
- Random upgrades (Damage, Speed, Multishot, etc.).
- Particle effects and synthesized sound effects.
